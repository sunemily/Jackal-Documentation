Weekly goals/progress report for Emily and Raghava:

Week 1 (2/1):
- (Goal) Go through 10 more tutorials
- Emily: Done
- Raghava: 3/10 done. Pushed b/c of career fair

Week 2 (2/8):
- (Goal) Try to move the Jackal on Gazebo, emulate lidar data
- Got two linux machines running in the lab!
- Emily:
  - Cloned common packages repo relevant for Jackal workspace related to messages, robot description, simulation etc. 
    (https://github.com/jackal/jackal)
  - Clearpath tutorial for navigating and making a map. 
  - Publish simple ROS message from terminal that translate to movement in Gazebo. 
  - Created simple publisher node that randomly moves Jackal in Gazebo.  
- Raghava:
 - Did many more tutorials.
 - Got the data from the LMS111 lidar on the Jackal
 - roslaunch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch config:=front_laser
 - Add /front/scan to rviz, or read it using the cmd-tool: rostopic echo/hz
 - Can similarly simulate bumblebee2 and flea3 cameras, using different config
   arguments.
 - jackal_navigation was not installed together with jackal-desktop for some reason.
   This is required for gmapping demos, and cna be installed by running: sudo apt-get
   install ros-indigo-jackal-navigation

(Meeting Notes)
 - Modify Gazebo model later. Work with Sick LMS111 for now
 - Work on planning, control
 - Meet Brian and Yutao Friday

Week 3 (2/15):
- (Goal): Generate wavepoints/path using A*, input wavepoints into Controller and have Jackal move from point A to B.
- (Bonus): Visualization of path in rviz. 
- Emily 
  - Simple package that sends goal using move_base
  - Ran into issues with not initializing the navstack
  - Will create own launch file that initializes navstack on gazebo startup
- Raghava

Week 4 (2/22):
- (Goal): Same as last week -- integrate A* and move_base 

Week 5 (3/1):
- (Goal): Create wiki page for general gazebo setup. Figure out logging and mount hokuyo in gazebo.
- Emily
  - Crtl-D to start recording in gazebo
  - All logs by default go to ~/.gazebo/log
  - Playback: open gazebo in playback mode (gazebo -u -p <log file>)
  - Can filter log files (gzlog <log file> --filter <information you want to see, eg. pose>)
  - Can also use gzlog to output state information at a simulation time (eg. 30 Hz) (-z 30)
  - http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=log_filtering&cat=tools_utilities
  - Logging in ROS using rosbag (rosbag record -O <rosbag file path> <rostopics>), Crtl-C to stop recording 
  - http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data
 - Raghava
  - Two options to add to Jackal URDF:
   - Set JACKAL_URDF_EXTRAS to point to your URDF file
   - Create new package for robot, wrapping one in 'jackal_description'

Weeks 6 and 7 (3/7):
- (Goal): Modify Jackal URDF, create new world in Gazebo -- tutorials too
