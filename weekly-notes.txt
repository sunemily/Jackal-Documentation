- Emily: Done
- Raghava: 3/10 done. Pushed b/c of career fair

Week 2 (2/8):
- (Goal) Try to move the Jackal on Gazebo, emulate lidar data
- Got two linux machines running in the lab!
- Emily:
  - Cloned common packages repo relevant for Jackal workspace related to messages, robot description, simulation etc. 
    (https://github.com/jackal/jackal)
  - Clearpath tutorial for navigating and making a map. 
  - Publish simple ROS message from terminal that translate to movement in Gazebo. 
  - Created simple publisher node that randomly moves Jackal in Gazebo.

 - Got the data from the LMS111 lidar on the Jackal
 - roslaunch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch config:=front_laser
 - Add /front/scan to rviz, or read it using the cmd-tool: rostopic echo/hz
 - Can similarly simulate bumblebee2 and flea3 cameras, using different config
   arguments.
 - jackal_navigation was not installed together with jackal-desktop for some reason.
   This is required for gmapping demos, and cna be installed by running: sudo apt-get
   install ros-indigo-jackal-navigation

 - Modify Gazebo model later. Work with Sick LMS111 for now
 - Work on planning, control
 - Meet Brian and Yutao Friday

Week 3 (2/15):
- (Goal): Generate wavepoints/path using A*, input wavepoints into Controller and have Jackal move from point A to B.
- (Bonus): Visualization of path in rviz.
